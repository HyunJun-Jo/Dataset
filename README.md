# Datasets
Datasets for object detection and instance segmentation. 
These are for YOLO, Faster R-CNN, and Mask R-CNN.
These datasets are published under the LGPL license and come with absolutely no guarantee.


**Datasets for object detection**
  - This dataset is written in VOC type.
  - Image files (.jpg, .png, .bmp) and annotations (.xml, .png) are included.
  - The structure of each dataset is as follows.

  ```
     --- Dataset
     ------- Images
     ---------- xxxxx.jpg(or other image extensions)
     ------- Annotations
     ---------- xxxxx.xml
  ```

**Instance segmenatation (Mask RCNN)**
  - This dataset is written in VOC type.
  - Image files (.jpg, .png, .bmp) and annotations (.xml, .png) are included.
  - The structure of each dataset is as follows.

  ```
     --- Dataset

**WRS dataset** (world robot summit - partner robot challenge in real space)
  - We participated in robocup 2019 and we used YOLO to recognize target objects.
  - This dataset is used there and used for training the YOLO v3.
